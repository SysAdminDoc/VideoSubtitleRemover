# Video Subtitle Remover Pro -- Roadmap

Remaining-work backlog only: every item below is NOT yet implemented.
Completed items are deleted from this file; history lives in CHANGELOG.md and git.



### Format support

73. **10-bit / HDR pipeline** -- HDR *metadata passthrough* shipped;
    remaining: re-plumb processing as 16-bit numpy (current pipeline
    clamps HDR10/HLG/DV to 8-bit SDR) and output via
    `libx265 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le`. H.264 cannot encode HDR; HEVC or AV1
    only. Dolby Vision needs a `dovi_tool` round-trip.

74. **AV1 + VP9 decode verification (remainder)** -- HEVC/AV1 egress
    shipped; remaining: verify AV1/VP9 decode across all codepaths and
    pair SVT-AV1 output with native film-grain synthesis.

### Simplification

117. **OpenCV 5 DNN for detection models** -- evaluate running RapidOCR's
     PP-OCR ONNX models through `cv2.dnn` instead of ONNX Runtime; if
     viable, the core detect+inpaint pipeline needs only OpenCV 5 + numpy.
     Priority: P2 simplification. Effort: L. Confidence: medium.
     Acceptance criteria:
     - PP-OCR detection and recognition models load and run via cv2.dnn
       with accuracy parity on reference clips.
     - ONNX Runtime path kept as fallback.
